q-pong
======

This was a quick project to learn how [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) works.

In this project, I set up two different agents to play pong. The first agent moves up and down depending on whether the ball is above or below it. The second agent uses Q-learning to change its strategy over time. This agent is seeded with random data, so its initial behavior might be quite off compared to the behavior that it converges to.

A live example is available [here](https://forestbelton.github.io/q-pong).
